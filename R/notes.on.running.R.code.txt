ISSUES

GENERAL
Explain naming convention somewhere(s)
Should we suppress messages?


Comments with descriptions of functions, input needed, output produced.
Renaming functions for clarity. Try using sed?
	 e.g. n.runs -> n.chains
	      reu13.df -> genome.codon.counts.df? If not what should it be?


PACKAGE
Code stops if it encounters a gene whose nt # is not a multiple of 3. That's okay but a more informative error message could be given.

Needed libraries should be checked at start of code (e.g. VGAM)

Thinning while running.
