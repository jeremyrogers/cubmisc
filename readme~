* rm_first_50aa

	without x obs, remove the first 50 aa then check if sequence is longer than 150 aa
		- simulating 4 chains 
		- initial sd log is 1, 0.25, 2, 3 
		- initial phi values drawn from logN with sd log of 1, 0.25, 2, 3 
		- use 1000 iterations for run, 1000 iterations for burn in.
		- min iterations 10000, max iterations 80000
		- check for convergence every 2000 iterations (use 3000)
		- convergence criterion was Gelman score < 1.05
		- final Gelman score is 1.1473 -> not converged according to criterion
